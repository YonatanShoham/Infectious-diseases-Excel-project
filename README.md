Project Description:

Title: Data Visualization for Hospital Acquired Infections

Introduction:
This project aims to create insightful data visualizations for hospital acquired infections. The visualizations will provide professionals in the healthcare industry with a clear understanding of the rates of acquired cases and their distribution across different hospitals and bacteria types. The project involves generating two types of graphs and presenting them in a professional manner.

Graph 1: Clustered Stacked Column Graph
The first graph focuses on the rate of acquired cases per 10,000 hospitalization days. It provides an overview of the cases acquired by hospitals in group 2. The graph employs a clustered stacked column format to represent the data effectively. Each column in the graph represents a hospital, and the stack within each column represents the different bacteria types. The legend indicates the color-coded data, with the lowest number of clinical cases positioned at the bottom. The graph also includes a cumulative value annotation above each column.

Graph 2: Stacked Column Graph
The second graph showcases the rate of acquired cases per 100,000 hospitalization days. It presents a detailed breakdown of the cases attributed to specific bacteria types (Aztinatbacter, VRE, CPE, and CD) across different hospitals and their respective groups. The stacked column format allows for a clear comparison of the infection rates among hospitals and the contribution of each bacteria type. Similar to the first graph, cumulative values are displayed above each column, offering a comprehensive perspective.

Implementation Steps:

Data Import:

Build a table and develop a data import mechanism from the Seker file.
Ensure that the column order remains unchanged, maintaining data integrity.
Data Cleansing and Formatting:

Validate and format all date columns to display only valid dates. Exclude invalid or incomplete dates from the visualization.
Cleanse any irrelevant or inaccurate data to ensure the accuracy of the final visualizations.
Graph Generation:

Utilize Excel to create the clustered stacked column graph and the stacked column graph.
Apply appropriate axis labels and titles to provide clarity and context to the visualizations.
Calculate the rates of acquired cases based on the given formulas for each graph.
Include cumulative value annotations above each column in both graphs to present the total values clearly.

Conclusion:
By implementing this project, professionals in the healthcare field will gain valuable insights into the rates of hospital acquired infections. The data visualizations will enable informed decision-making and facilitate discussions on infection control strategies, resource allocation, and the identification of potential areas for improvement. The visual representations will be presented in a professional and user-friendly format, ensuring that the information is easily accessible and impactful for the intended audience.
